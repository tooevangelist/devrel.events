#### You can star this repo to see how this all develops =)

#### Like what we're doing?
Want to have our event at your office or venue? 

As a host you may have a strong influence on event agenda and the main talking slot. We'd work together to figure out what works best for the community and you.

Currently we don't charge anyone anything. You can raise an issue here or reach us at devrel.events@gmail.com to learn how this works.

As a host you're responsible for guests to feel safe and welcome. Food and drinks are optional but a very nice thing to have. The rest is on us.

#### Other opportunities:
* We're experimenting with recording and live-streaming of our events. Let us know if you're interested to chip in.
* Collabs. Communication partners. Anything fun and useful is appreciated.
