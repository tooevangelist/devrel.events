![](/img/cfp_girl_400.png)

Games Tech + Stories is a [series of community meetups](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/developer-relations-events-26740448969) to discuss game development tools and processes but also to celebrate the wins of the local gamedev industry. 

Each meetup features a Games/Tech Showcase where we show your short video and rave about what’s cool about your game, tech solution, Unity plugin, beautiful shader… you tell us what to rave about =)

#### Apply to talk at GT+S
We wanted to be inclusive and friendly to those not in Vilnius, so we can rave about your video. Or you can make a video and rave about it yourself at the event.

Make a 3 to 5 minutes video and submit it by [raising an issue](../../issues/new) or just email to devrel.events@gmail.com

#### Don't like this whole video thing? Need any help? Want to do a live demo instead? 
Who we are to tell you what to do ;-) All initiatives are welcome. Let's talk, [here](../../issues/new), [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/devrelevents) or [email](mailto:devrel.events@gmail.com).

#### What else is there?
Beyond the Games/Tech Showcase each meetup has a technical keynote and a nice story to cheer the people involved and remember the wins of Lithuanian gamedev industry.
