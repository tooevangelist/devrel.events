## CfP for Games Tech + Stories meetups

![](/img/cfp_girl_400.png)

Games Tech + Stories is a [series of community meetups](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/developer-relations-events-26740448969) to discuss game development tools and processes but also to celebrate the wins of the local gamedev industry. 

Each meetup features a Games/Tech Showcase where we show your short video and rave about what’s cool about your game, tech solution, Unity plugin, beautiful shader… you tell us what to rave about =)

#### The schedule for Games Tech + Stories meetups:
* [March 26](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/games-tech-stories-meetup-tickets-96506685093)
* April 9
* May 27

#### How this CfP works
1) pick the event date that works best for you
2) see the first 30 minutes slot for games and tech showcases? That's what you can apply for. No, not the whole slot. Read on. 
3) We want to be super inclusive, so an industry vet with 20 years or experience and a student with a nice shader have equal opportunities to show their work. Meaning you want to __show what you've done and why it is cool__. You don't want to do deep dive into tech. It is more of a beauty contest for tech. Because games tech is beautiful!
4) How can you show the beauty of your games tech solution in a video or 3-4 slides? How can you tell why it is cool in under 5 minutes? Have no ideas? Let's [discuss it here](https://github.com/tooevangelist/devrel.events/issues/1) or over an email: devrel.events@gmail.com
5) Now you have the right mindset to apply for a talk, which is really a showcase. Read on below.

#### Apply to talk at GT+S
We wanted to be inclusive and friendly to those not in Vilnius, so we can rave about your video. Or you can make a video and rave about it yourself at the event. Or you can make a few slides. 

* You can make a short video and we'll show it
* You can make slides and we'll show them
* You can show up at the event and present yourself
* You have 5 to 15 minutes for everything. Not more. 
* Doubt? Confused? [Discuss it here](https://github.com/tooevangelist/devrel.events/issues/1)

Submit an idea for what you wanna show by [raising an issue](../../issues/new) or just email to devrel.events@gmail.com
Both ways are equally good. 

#### Don't like this whole video thing? Need any help? Want to do a live demo instead? 
Who we are to tell you what to do ;-) All initiatives are welcome. Let's talk, [here](https://github.com/tooevangelist/devrel.events/issues/1), [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/devrelevents) or via [email](mailto:devrel.events@gmail.com).

#### What else is there?
Beyond the Games/Tech Showcase each meetup has a technical keynote and a nice story to cheer the people involved and remember the wins of Lithuanian gamedev industry.
