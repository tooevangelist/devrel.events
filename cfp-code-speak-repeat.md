## Apply for speaking
Would you like to share your experience on any of the suggested topics to inspire fellow programmers to do more public talks? Do you have a better topic in mind? [Raise an issue](../../issues/new) or email to devrel.events@gmail.com

Each meetup features a workshop where we discuss common speaker challenges like:
* Why speak at a local meetup
* Being in the centre of attention as a speaker
* Why public speaking is useful for me as a programmer
* How do I persuade my manager to send me to a developer conference
* Why and when decline a speaking opportunity

Youâ€™re very welcome to join as an attendee, bring in your own topic for a workshop and/or facilitate a discussion for any of the workshop topics.

Thank you!
