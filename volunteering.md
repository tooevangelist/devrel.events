## Why and how to volunteer at our events
We're figuring out the best ways to make it all work...

## Some volunteering ideas

#### Video/Audio
We do awesome community events but don't record or live-stream them because we'd need more people for this.
We more or less have the basic equipment, but somebody has to 
* set and test everything on the spot
* monitor that all works well
* hotfix the fires
* talk to the online community
* process the audio and video, cut and publish
* YouTube or podcasts? Yeah, that also.
* figure out the design/graphics so it looks and feels good

#### Graphics/Imagery
There are many ideas to make these community events even better by producing nice art that people can relate to. Yeah, with time we'll have budgets for an artist. But perhaps you feel like volunteering to
* draw cover images for our events
* help with design and style
* sketch or draw speaker avatars
* help with slides, website design and communications overall
* help with imagery for newsletters or event debriefs

#### Marketing/Communications
We're postponing many cool things because there's just so much that we can do now. If you're studying and/or are curious about social media, marketing, communications, PR - perhaps you can get real-life practise by volunteering for us?

#### Co-host/Co-org
This one is hard. Don't even know what to type in here. Imagine you're helping to org and run one (or more) of our events. In practice this means you're there on the scene with a mic, helping to make the event fun and welcoming to everybody.
Probably you're loud and engaging. Maybe you're studying, maybe you're just like being in the centre of attention. Do you see yourself being all-in for one or more of our events because you just like it, or can attach this as a practice to your studies?
