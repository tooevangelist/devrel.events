## Why and how to volunteer at our events
We're responsible for developers-focused community meetups in Stockholm and Vilnius:
* [Our events on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pg/devrel.events/events)
* [Our events on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/developer-relations-events-26740448969)

Feel free to unitarelary dictate what would you like to help out with, what's the capacity you'd like to offer and what would you like to get back. As an example, here's the [eventual volunteering offer/agreement](#example) to two humans who wanted to help with communications.

## Some volunteering ideas

#### Video/Audio
We do awesome community events but don't record or live-stream them because we'd need more people for this.
We more or less have the basic equipment, but somebody has to 
* set and test everything on the spot
* monitor that all works well
* hotfix the fires
* talk to the online community
* process the audio and video, cut and publish
* YouTube or podcasts? Yeah, that also.
* figure out the design/graphics so it looks and feels good

#### Graphics/Imagery
There are many ideas to make these community events even better by producing nice art that people can relate to. Yeah, with time we'll have budgets for an artist. But perhaps you feel like volunteering to
* draw cover images for our events
* help with design and style
* sketch or draw speaker avatars
* help with slides, website design and communications overall
* help with imagery for newsletters or event debriefs

#### Marketing/Communications
We're postponing many cool things because there's just so much that we can do now. If you're studying and/or are curious about social media, marketing, communications, PR - perhaps you can get real-life practise by volunteering for us?

#### Co-host/Co-org
This one can have many ways of doing.
1) Imagine you're helping to org and run one (or more) of our events. In practice this means you're there on the scene with a mic, helping to make the event fun and welcoming to everybody.

2) Probably you're loud and engaging. Maybe you're studying, maybe you're just like being in the centre of attention. You can be an all-in for one or more of our events because you just like it, or can attach this as a practice to your studies.

3) Another side of it is if you're into production or narrative work and what to help out with a narrative event design, mood, flow, topics. One way to do it is to have a chat where we'd discuss how the event works from the narrative/production side of things, brainstorm ideas for the next events, think about speakers or presentation topics.

Interested to help? Can you show up at [any of our events](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/developer-relations-events-26740448969)? Email us to devrel.events@gmail.com or [raise an issue](/../../issues/new) to discuss the opportunity. 

## Example
This is the offer/agreement that we ended up having with folks who wanted to help with writing/communications.
We'd figure out a mutually beneficial and fun agreement on whatever you'd like to help us with.

> Here's the deal as I see it now.
>
> You want to become better at writing. You think it is fun to blog about game development. 
> So let's talk how volunteering for devrel.events may help you with these 2 goals.
>
> 1) I have both writing and editing experience, also near-native English to help you sound better. So I'll review your work, mentor you as a writer.
> 2) I'll work hard to give you access to GT+S speakers and will help shape up the question list and figure out best interview/blogpost format.
> 3) Distribution and endorsement. Before and after each GT+S event we'll send out newsletters to the attendees. Each newsletter will have slots for your creatives that could link to i.e. your blog/website/medium/etc.
>
> Round up: 
> 1) I help you become better at writing, at English, assist with content and editing
> 2) You commit to doing two pieces of content** for each GT+S event - one before and one few days after*** the event.
>
> ** I will advice on kind/length/format of the content, but you decide yourself if you want to follow my advice
>
> *** We'll have a shared Trello board for convenience and observable deadlines
> 
> Makes any sense?
